summary: "Gardener panel (3b.2): /zespol/zlecenia request triage (accept→schedule / decline / done) and a shared team schedule /zespol/grafik backed by a new visits collection — single dated visits, optional assignee. The team boundary is role==gardener (requireGardener), every query tenant-scoped."

## Purpose
Closes the order loop. A customer's `service-request` ([[service-requests]]) lands as
`new`; this zone is where the Kryscar team acts on it. At `/zespol/zlecenia` a gardener
triages requests grouped **Nowe / W realizacji / Archiwum**: **Przyjmij** (pick a first
visit date → request `accepted`, a `visits` row is created) · **Odrzuć** (reason, visible
to the customer → `declined`) · **Zakończ zlecenie** (`accepted` → `done`). At
`/zespol/grafik` the shared team agenda lists visits by day (soonest first, **Zaległe**
past-planned surfaced on top): **Wykonana** · **Odwołaj** · **Zaplanuj kolejną**
(pre-filled date). The customer sees status changes in `/panel/zamowienia` and the next
planned visit on `/panel` ("Najbliższa wizyta").

## Lifecycle
```
customer creates ─────────────────────► new
new ── accept (+first visit date) ─────► accepted   (visit row, status planned)
new ── decline (+reason) ──────────────► declined
new / accepted ── customer cancel ─────► cancelled  (planned visits → cancelled)
accepted ── "Zakończ zlecenie" ────────► done
```

## Trust boundary
`requireGardener()` (`src/lib/team-auth.ts`) resolves the Better Auth session, looks up
the Payload role + tenant, and returns `{ userId, tenantId }` only for a gardener — every
`/zespol` server action calls it first (actions are directly callable, so the layout gate
is not enough). `src/lib/team.ts` carries the tenant filter on every query; `acceptRequest`
uses a conditional CAS so concurrent accepts can't double-book. The `visits` collection is
access-closed like lawns/service-requests; security lives in the data layer
([[lawns-ownership-in-data-layer]]). Visits reach `/api/mcp` only through the admin
carve-out ([[mcp-principal-is-admins]]).

## Data
`visits` collection: `request` · `lawn` · `customer` (denormalized for cheap agenda +
"najbliższe wizyty" queries) · `scheduledAt` · `assignee` (optional, informational) ·
`status` (planned/done/cancelled) · `note` · `tenant`. `service-requests.status` gained
`accepted/declined/done` and a `declineReason` ([[service-requests]]).

## Navigation feedback
Both `/zespol/zlecenia` and `/zespol/grafik` ship a route-level `loading.tsx`
(plus a generic one at the segment root) — the AppShell chrome persists, so on a
nav click the skeleton paints instantly while the dynamic auth + Neon queries
stream in (the same loading-boundary pattern as `panel/loading.tsx`). Each fallback
mirrors its page's real shape: zlecenia = a 2-col grid of map-snapshot cards,
grafik = day-grouped visit rows.

## Anchors
`Visits` (collection), `requireGardener` (team gate), `getTenantRequests` + `acceptRequest`
+ `declineRequest` + `completeRequest` (team.ts), `getTeamVisits` + `getUpcomingVisitsForCustomer`
+ `createVisit` + `setVisitStatus` + `suggestNextVisitDate` + `canTransitionRequest` (visits.ts),
`RequestTriageCard` + `VisitCard` (components/team).
